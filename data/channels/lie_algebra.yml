  Let \(\mathfrak{g}\) be a semisimple Lie algebra of dimension \(k\) with basis \(\{X_i\}_{i=1}^{k}\). Let \((\alpha, \mathcal{H})\) be an irreducible representation of \(\mathfrak{g}\) of dimension \(d\). A Lie algebra channel \cite{doi:10.1063/1.1945768} is then given by 
  \[\mathcal{E}(\rho) = (1-p) \rho + \frac{p}{Z} \sum_{i=1}^{k}\alpha(X_i) \: \rho \: \alpha(X_i),\] where \(Z\) is a normalization constant and \(p \in [0,1]\).

  One can interpret this definition as a generalization of the depolarizing channel, with an input qudit remaining intact with probability \(1-p\), and an error occurring with probability \(p\), with each of the errors \(\{\alpha(X_i)\}_{i=1}^{k}\) being equally likely.

  For the defining representation of the Lie algebra \(\mathfrak{su}(d)\), this definition gives the \hyperref[channel:high_dim_depolar]{qudit depolarizing channel}.
